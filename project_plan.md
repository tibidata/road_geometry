## Short description of the project 
>The project is a school project for the 'Computer aided modeling' course at the University of Szeged. The goal of the project is to implement two clustering algorithms based on a paper published by Judit Nagy-György, Norbert Bogya, Zsolt Vizi and Róbert Fazekas. The algorithms are already implemented in Matlab my goal is to implement them in python.

## Description of the used technologies
> During the project I'm planning to use several python libraries:
> - Matplotlib
> - Numpy
> - OpenCV
> - Pandas
> - Scipy
> - Sklearn

> Development environment:
> - PyCharm

> Version control system:
> - Github

>If needed I will use other programming languages like Go or Julia.

## Minimum viable product
> The purpose of the minimum viable product is to show the customers a pre-release product which can also be tested at the market.

> The MVP of this project should have the following abilities:
> 1) The image processing is fully working and can turn a video of the road into readable data
> 2) Both of the 2 algorithm can successfully cluster the different road objects on test videos
> 3) The combined algorithm can successfully cluster different road objects on the videos and can plan the best route to avoid them with a success rate of 65%
