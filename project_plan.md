## Short description of the project 
The project is a school project for the 'Computer aided modeling' course at the University of Szeged. The goal of the project is to implement two clustering algorithms based on a paper published by Judit Nagy-György, Norbert Bogya, Zsolt Vizi and Róbert Fazekas. The algorithms are already implemented in Matlab my goal is to implement them in python.

## Description of the used technologies
During the project I'm planning to use several python libraries:
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- OpenCV
- Pandas
- Scipy
- Sklearn

Development environment:
- PyCharm

Version control system:
- Github

If needed I will use other programming languages like Go or Julia.
